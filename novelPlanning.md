# TLR Planning

## Themes
there needs to be a sense of dynamism. age. right now there is the old and the current. theres no sense of progression. of the distances between. the current too closely resembles the old. Theres also no sense of evolution. except perhaps with the sidrigati, and to a certain degree the kurasans. 

training and breeding differentiate the various supernatural orders from the common, but really its training, as strange blood abounds. 

the continuity of memory
orders shaped by training
religions
some kind of connective tissue. the nations do not exist in isolation. 
the halabor connect their sorcerers the preserved minds of their Tutors?
SOMETHING is in the collective unconscious. its no longer just a mechanism. its had millennia for the prayers, souls, and minds of mankind to shape it. _a presaged awakening? the slumbering god of the Jat?_ 

## Plot

### Characters
* the duelist, raised a slave, is somehow catalyzed into throwing off the chains that he’d practically been born in. His will to freedom metastasizes into a full blown fanatic hate when he uncovers that the agents of the Deceiver have returned from over the mountains and once again try to leash his people for its plots. 
* a sorcerer
* The Wanderer: the youngest son of the Apostate and the Lady, the only one of their children born with sufficient strangeness to interest his father, and thus taken and hidden among his mother’s people. He lacked their magic, but possessed a biological and spiritual sophistication that was completely unparalleled. He was instrumental in the development of the 3rd Linguistics, but assumption of it transfigured him. It unified his wisdom and his strange physiological abilities, rendering him immortal. Fearing madness, and what could be made of him by the Bathics were he to go mad, he walls off his personality deep inside, and wanders the world. Tales persist to this day of “the ageless, forgetting wanderer”. a man cursed to live life after life, forgetting each in turn. Said to a sign of luck to treat him with kindness. Accorded great respect among the Jat, which is weird in of itself.
