# TLR Planning

## Themes
there needs to be a sense of dynamism. age. right now there is the old and the current. theres no sense of progression. of the distances between. the current too closely resembles the old. Theres also no sense of evolution. except perhaps with the sidrigati, and to a certain degree the kurasans. 

training and breeding differentiate the various supernatural orders from the common, but really its training, as strange blood abounds. 

the continuity of memory
orders shaped by training
religions
some kind of connective tissue. the nations do not exist in isolation. 
the halabor connect their sorcerers the preserved minds of their Tutors?
SOMETHING is in the collective unconscious. its no longer just a mechanism. its had millennia for the prayers, souls, and minds of mankind to shape it. _a presaged awakening? the slumbering god of the Jat?_ 

## Plot

The Prime Mover of the plot is the apotheosis of the UC. Is this inevitable? does it require something? 

### Epic Level
* the bathics are returning. kadeth has come back over the mountains, and the twins’ tomb has been located. 
* The CU is approaching the informational density threshold after which it will attain true sentience. its effectively an accidentally made AI/God. exactly what its nature will be once it awakens, what that means for the bathics and sorcery, is unknown. 
* the Jat, via the third linguistics, have some intimation that this is a possibility, if not the timing. as a consequence, for the last few hundred years, they have begun seeding this prophecy into as many of the other religions as they can. their own religious views are zealously guarded. no one has any idea what the fuck the Jat believe. 

### Threads
* Sidrigan - independence vs tradition, in the form of the returned bathic lord
* sorcerous exposition
* Jat and religious exposition

## Characters
* the duelist, raised a slave, is somehow catalyzed into throwing off the chains that he’d practically been born in. His will to freedom metastasizes into a full blown fanatic hate when he uncovers that the agents of the Deceiver have returned from over the mountains and once again try to leash his people for its plots. 
* a sorcerer
* The Wanderer: the youngest son of the Apostate and the Lady, the only one of their children born with sufficient strangeness to interest his father, and thus taken and hidden among his mother’s people. He lacked their magic, but possessed a biological and spiritual sophistication that was completely unparalleled. He was instrumental in the development of the 3rd Linguistics, but assumption of it transfigured him. It unified his wisdom and his strange physiological abilities, rendering him immortal. Fearing madness, and what could be made of him by the Bathics were he to go mad, he walls off his personality deep inside, and wanders the world. Tales persist to this day of “the ageless, forgetting wanderer”. a man cursed to live life after life, forgetting each in turn. Said to a sign of luck to treat him with kindness. Accorded great respect among the Jat, which is weird in of itself.
* The Twins: Former members of the Jat who were assigned to the Adugair redoubt. Early in the Ash Years, the arrival of the Untrelaged Hecatomb resulted in their corruption. They volunteered for an early version of the hybrid ritual, but subverted it. The result was that they achieved a potency equal to or exceeding that of any of the hecatombs. They are recorded as having been “destroyed” at the end of the Reclamation, but its known in some circles that these records are inaccurate. They went into hiding/hibernation. 
* Untrelaged: Also known as the Black Tree, Scourge of Adugair. A last generation Hecatomb that is as close as they ever got to creating a legitimate sorcerous power. Though it still remains trapped “within the circle of the world”, its achieved a level of complexity and subtlety that makes it incredibly potent and dangerous. At the end of the Reclamation, the ship that was carrying the Hecatomb was destroyed by the Jat. The Hecatomb sunk to the bottom of the Maelstrom. 
* Kadeth: A mid-generation hecatomb whose design resulted in a particular adeptness with political and interpersonal manipulation. His sorcerous talents, at this stage, are limited basically to self defense and communication, but unmatched when it comes to possession and manipulation. His followers faked his destruction at the end of the Reclamation and spirited him north, over the supposedly impassible Inebet Mountains into the unknown territory beyond them. Has recently returned over the mountains and taken up residence in the ruins of his former base of operations, and is beginning to attempt to  regain control of his former territory, aka Sidrigan.
