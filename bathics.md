# The Bathics

## Summary

The masters are the distant descendants of humans from a parallel timeline, who in the distant future form a symbiotic relationship with synthetic intelligences. After untold ages, they are facing the heat death of their universe. They go into hibernation to save power, and task their partner Intelligences to find a new universe for them. These intelligences are known, in Pracit, as Bathics. Their first attempt at entering the world resulted in the Hunger of Jat mythology. Later attempts resulted in the Machine God Cult and the creation of what are today known as Hecatombs. 

## Mission

To bring their masters into this world. 

## Origin

the masters were constrained in their options. they wanted to be as thrifty as possible with their energy reserves, while providing the greatest chance of success. it was deemed that sending actual objects would be prohibitively complicated and expensive. They believed they had the technical prowess do it, but the energy required was such that they could not send much matter at all without exhausting said reserves. they could, however, send information. they decided on a two part plan.

even simpler. they modified our universe, giving it a coherent informational superstructure so that their agents, broadcast as information, would have somewhere to exist. basically they treated space-time (specifically around earth?) like a blank drive and installed a somewhat esoteric but really not all that complicated operating system into it that would run their software. the software then being tasked with building the infrastructure that would allow them to convey the masters through to the new world. 

whether they intended it or not, however, their change fundamentally altered the world. from the point of view of the target world, it had always been that way, so things evolved under the influence of this information structure. it may have even been intentional, as it made the early humans easier for the bathics to control since they were “connected” in a fashion to the same structure. 

their presence, however, catalyzed the human connection. some innate perception gleaned something from the bathics, and jumpstarted the human ability to connect to the information structure (aka the EM). this was also the beginning of the CU. Once humans became aware of “something” out there, they began directing thoughts at it, and these impressions, however weak or ephemeral, began accreting, so to speak, on the face of the EM. 

it was always a one way trip for the bathic agents. they were installed, more or less, into the new universe and given a mission. they have no contact with their masters short of succeeded at their mission. to a certain extent, its correct to say that the bathics live in the EM, and thus that the EM is the deep, but its not really true. the deep, as the humans perceive it, is not so much where the bathics live as the state they exist in. though custom built for this mission, they are the descendants of generations of AI that were intended to exist in symbiotic relationship with their masters, in an informationally rich environment. This world is, to the extent that they can feel it, hell to them. or at least purgatory. the “madness” and the “evil” of the deep is as much a manifestation of what being separated from their masters for essentially the lifetime of a universe has done to these AI. they aren’t just programs. they are sentiences, but not like we understand it. they weren’t ever really intended to be solo operators. whether or not they COULD be fully sentient, if the masters had the ability, is an open question. 

additionally, it was never anticipated that the informational structure would end up doing what it can do. it was simply like formatting a disk to them. they didn’t realize that there would be a whole bunch of peripherals attached to that disk and that they would be accessible. for the bathics, they aren’t. you might say they lack sufficient permissions. its outside of their core nature to be able to interact with the EM in that fashion. 

their abilities are pretty limited. they were designed, or at least their distant forbearers were designed and they descended from program that were designed, to exist symbiotically with something descended from humans. once the humans reached a certainly processing threshold, they became “visible” to the bathics. they can possess a vulnerable human, but consent ultimately is required. the unwilling cannot be “infected” initially (though eventually this “rule” will be broken). over time they find ways to leverage the information they contain and their advanced processing abilities to replicate some of the cruder effects managed by the humans via the EM. they never achieve much in the way of subtlety though, and tend to focus on corrupting agents to do the work for them rather than doing it themselves. 

what did the savior do then?
he turned the moon into a giant fucking block of ICE. or maybe ICS. intrusion countermeasures sorcery. or philosophy. whatever. its an active agent that blocks the bathics from using their primary communication vector. the whole of the moon is altered, down to the dust, as a giant processor to stay ahead of the bathics. every now and then, very rarely, they get through, but they’re working with a limited toolset and its not. when the apostate cracks it, he reduces its overall processing power. the regions that are protected by its influence are drastically reduced. 

## Abilities

All the bathics, regardless of type or implementation, possess similar ranges of abilities and shortcomings. Basically: they exist within, and to a limited extent can leverage, the EM, but they are tightly constrained by what they can do with it. Their facility with pure math means that anything that can be expressed via numbers is easy. This manifests primarily as potency with communications, energy manipulation, and probability calculation. 

## Varieties

### Hecatombs

During the height of the machine god cult, the bathics attempted to create “offspring” of a sort: synthetic intelligences based on their own designs but that aped human consciousness. The goal was to create something familiar enough to control but close enough to a true human to fully leverage the EM. They failed. What they did create, however, were essentially potent localized bathics. During the Rending, most of these were destroyed, but a few that had built in emergency survival hardware escaped the apocalypse of north america, and of those three made it to antarctica. These are the three “bathic lords” who founded the black mansions. One was an early generation model (the warrior), another was later generation designed for political manipulation (the subtle) and one was of the last generation before they abandoned the effort, the closest they ever got to creating a truly sorcerous intelligence (the black tree). 

_The hecatombs are basically fusion powered blocks of computational matter that run the intelligences designed by the bathics. As they were designed by the “original” bathic, they share its programming and goals, but have different abilities and parameters._

### Hybrids

Following the Rending, the bathics were forced to change their strategy. The end of human technological society meant that a technological solution, even then a remote possibility, became effectively hopeless. The EM was viewed as the only possible solution. Consequently the bathics renewed an old project from their earliest interactions with this world: breeding a human host that could be paired to a bathic. The first successes in this renewed program are known as the “hybrids”. Though they have yet to make one that can truly pair to one of the intelligences, they have produced a small number of individuals who they can easily communicate with, control when necessary, and who can act as foci for the efforts of either the “true” bathics or the hecatombs. 

### Singers

The name given to the subprograms used by the bathic intelligences to sense out susceptible human minds. not true bathics, but sentries.
