# The Nations

The long shadow of the redoubts can be strongly felt in the way that the modern denizens of the pannonian region cling to national identities despite the substantial distances both cultural and geographic that separate many of them. The habit of conforming to a perceived social center was ruthlessly enforced during the ash years, as the smallest deviation was thought to put the entire at risk. Though two thousand years have passed, and much of those lessons have faded, this is one that is apparently engrained into every people. _It is also possible that this is one of the things that the Lady had her daughter encourage when she created the trees_. 

There are six major human nations in the Pannonian region: 
- [Kurasa](kurasa.md)
- [Ithilien League (Jathayoth)](jathayoth.md)
- [Sidrigan](sidrigan.md)
- [Mapithel](mapithel.md)
- [Cisiv](cisiv.md)
- [Dakkar](dakkar.md)

[Ostorelin](ostorelin.md) is a bit of a special case, as its really only a single city and the region immediately surrounding it, and any other city probably would have been absorbed by Kurasa, but as the home of the Oruboran Sorcery schools, its maintained its independence and identity long after the ruins of the Redoubt from which it originated have been lost. 

There are a number of smaller tribes and societies, mostly branches of these nations or ash blooded in origin. 

There are two other nations which do not, for various reasons, qualify as “human” nations per se:
- [Jat Vayhar (Antalla)](JatVayhar.md)
- [Tladhua](tladhua.md)
